This is the solution of Q2, part a and b

There are 3 notebooks:
	- NMF.ipynb: with nmf of part a dimensionality reduction and part b classification.
	- PCA.ipynb: with PCA implementation for part a
	- PLCA.ipynb: with PLCA implementation for part a

These three notebooks could not be combined into one because of very different implementations and the length of each notebook is too much to keep a single notebook organized.
